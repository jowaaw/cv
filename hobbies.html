        <li> <strong>Travel</strong> </li>
        <p>I love seeing new places and learning from them. Going to a different place gives you the perspective on the locals' way of life, confirmation (or debunking)
          of common sterotypes, rich history, delectable cuisines, and unique products not found at home. One of my goals is to be able to go to 30 countries before turning 30 years old.
          So far, I've been to 21. Below are some photos of places I've been to:</p>

        <li> <strong>Business</strong></li>
        <p>One of my passions is doing business. As a child, I always loved creating things and "selling" them to my parents.
          Over the years, I started a couple of small businesses - some were flops, some were okay, but right now, I'm still looking for the "big break".
          Currently, I have two small businesses running. Check them out below:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MagisSeafood/">Magis Seafood</a> is a supplier of premium fresh oysters flown from sea to the table and crispy fried shrimps to restaurants and retail customers. </li>
          <li> <a href="http://www.huelifestyleco.com">HUE Lifestyle Co.</a> is a lifestyle brand which focuses on health and wellness. Currently serving two types of products (Coffee and Tea) with five varieties each.
            In the future, more products will launch such as basic cosmetics, bath and body products, and more.</li>
        </ol>

        <li> <strong>Leisure</strong></li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li> <em>Sports</em> </li>
          <p>I enjoy doing sports especially with friends. I prefer sports that need minimal equipment to play such as the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Running</li>
            <li>Basketball</li>
            <li>Swimming</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li><em>Beer Pong</em></li>
          <p> As a beer lover, I've also developed a love for playing beer pong, the drinking game where there are cups on both sides and players will try to shoot ping pong balls in the enemy's cup.
            For every shot that sinks in the cup, the player drinks the contents, mot often beer.</p>
